# Coffee4Clients

Coffee4Clients allows Express.js to render `.coffee` files when `?js` is appended to their urls.


## Example

- http://localhost:5000/asd.coffee
	
	``` coffeescript
	alert 'asd'
	```

- http://localhost:5000/asd.coffee?js

	``` javascript
	(function() {
	  alert("awesome");
	}).call(this);
	```

## Using

- With Node.js in JavaScript

	``` javascript
	// Include Coffee4Clients

	// Setup with your Express Server
	coffee4clients.createInstance({
		server: null, // your express server (required)
